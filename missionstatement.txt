The core mission of wTRTL is to build upon the legacy of TurtleCoin V1 while also addressing the challenges faced by the community in the past. With over 85% of the TurtleCoin V1 supply swapped to Fantom Opera, the TurtleCoin V1 network has concluded on block 5.5 million. wTRTL aims to prioritize DeFi education and community growth, with a particular focus on empowering members to initiate their own DeFi projects and share industry insights. Our approach emphasizes value creation through fun and learning, with profit being a secondary consideration. Capital games that do not contribute to value creation are discouraged, and we strive to develop a robust community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about decentralized finance and cryptocurrency.

As a community-driven project, wTRTL fosters an environment that encourages participation, collaboration, and innovation. We believe that the success of the project depends on the engagement and commitment of our members. In the near term, wTRTL will concentrate on DeFi education and community growth. To support this focus, we will provide resources, tools, and support to enhance members' comprehension of decentralized finance and enable them to create their DeFi projects. Furthermore, we will promote knowledge sharing and collaboration within the community, allowing members to learn from one another and collaborate on projects of mutual interest.

As we progress, we will begin discussions about transitioning to TurtleCoin V2. TurtleCoin V2 has features designed to be more decentralized, quantum-resistant, and environmentally conscious. We recognize the significance of maintaining open communication with our members throughout the transition process and will strive to ensure an innovation-based transition to the new network in the years ahead.
